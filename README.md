MoCOCrW
===================================================

(mo)dern (c)++ (o)penssl (cr)ypto (w)rapper library
===================================================

As part of our development efforts we noticed that there are cryptographic
primitives that are needed in many different situations. Unfortunately,
most of the libraries are only in C and the only library that implements all
the different algorithms/modes and primitives is OpenSSL.

OpenSSL is hard to use and does not integrate well in a C++14/17 development
environment. Consequently, we decided to provide a wrapping framework around
OpenSSL with the following goals in mind:
 * Translation of OpenSSL memory management into C++ memory management concepts
 * Good testability - in particular all calls to OpenSSL should be mockable
 * Extensive automatic testing
 * Easy to use end-user interface for common features

This library is the work-in-progress result of the above ideas.

## Support

We currently support OpenSSL in the 1.0.2 branch. An update to OpenSSL 1.1 is
planned but currently **not** supported. It is developed and tested mainly for
an x86_64 target with Linux. However, there is no general limitation to that.


The library provides end-user interfaces for:
 * X509 certificate processing
 * X509 certificate CA functionality
 * CRLs
 * RSA key management

## Building

The library contains CMake build scripts. As a dependency, your build environment should
have development packages for the following libraries installed:
 * OpenSSL (1.0.2 branch)
 * Boost
 * gtest/gmock

In order to build the library with tests, do
```
$ mkdir build; cd build
build/$ cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=True ..
build/$ make
build/$ ctest . --output-on-failure
```

The bci.config file is used by our internal validation environment, please just ignore it.

## Installation / Usage / Packaging

MoCOCrW is prepared to be installed or packaged into an SDK. It also provides a a cmake
exported target that you can use in your projects. A minimal example how to use this cmake
integration can be found in `tests/sdk`. This can also be used as an integration test if you
want to ship MoCOCrW with an SDK.

Unfortunately, there is not a lot of usage examples available right now. You may have a look
at the unit tests to see the API in action.

Most functionality is already documented in a doxygen style documentation in code.
More examples and a complete documentation will follow.

## Support / Comments

Support for this library will be provided on a best-effort basis. However, we encourage
you to submit bugs or contact us via github if there is an issue.

## Doxygen Documentation

In order to generate the doxygen documentation please follow the next steps:
on the project build directory run:

cmake -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON ..
make doc
